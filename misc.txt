Milestone-2:
We are currently implementing ANN code, with 400 neurons at input layer(one image,features is studied one at a time)
1 hidden layer neuron, 1 o/p layer neuron bcz its binary classification





Milestone-3:
Multi-classification
5-15 hidden layer neurons
n o/p layer neurons for n diseases followed by softmax(prop of a image belong to a certain disease->prob of image being what disease)
CNN
MERN stcak implementation for more options
